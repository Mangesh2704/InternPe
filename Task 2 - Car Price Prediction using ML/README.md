# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Car Price Predictor is a Python application that uses Machine Learning to predict the price of used cars. It provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to input details about a car, such as the car's name, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, and fuel type (Petrol), and it predicts the approximate price of the car.

## Features

- Predict the price of a used car based on input parameters.
- Easy-to-use GUI for a seamless user experience.
- Utilizes a Linear Regression model to make predictions.
- Handles missing and invalid data gracefully.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your local machine.
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyQt5) installed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Car-Price-Predictor.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already.

```shell
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn PyQt5
```

3. Run the application.

```shell
python car_price_predictor.py
```

4. Input the car's name, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, and select the fuel type (Petrol).

5. Click the "Predict Price" button to get the predicted price for the car.
