# Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a Diabetes Prediction model using Machine Learning techniques. It allows you to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on various health-related features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project, named "diabetes.csv," contains several features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The target variable is "Outcome," where 1 represents a diabetic patient and 0 represents a non-diabetic patient.

## Model and Evaluation

We employed a Logistic Regression model for prediction and evaluated its performance using various metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity (true positive rate), and specificity (true negative rate).

### Key Results:
- Accuracy: 74.68 %
- Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): 209.09 %
- Specificity (True Negative Rate): 116.16%

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Replace "diabetes.csv" with your own dataset or adjust the file path accordingly.
3. Run the code to train the model and make predictions.
4. Input new data for prediction and get results in a human-readable format.
