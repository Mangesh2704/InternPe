## Overview

The IPL Winning Team Prediction App is a Python application that predicts the winning team for an IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match based on user-selected parameters such as the participating teams, venue, and toss winner. It analyzes historical IPL match data to make predictions.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users to input match details and get predictions.

- **Match Prediction:** Users can select two IPL teams, a venue, and the toss winner for a match. The app uses historical match data to predict the winning team for the specified conditions.

- **Real-Time Feedback:** After inputting match details and clicking the "Predict Winner" button, users receive real-time feedback on the predicted winning team.
